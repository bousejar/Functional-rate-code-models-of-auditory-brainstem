# Functional-rate-code-models-of-auditory-brainstem
Implementations of MSO and LSO binaural models predicting lateralization and discrimination data of human binaural perception. Full description of implementation is published here http://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.5084264 


To run the simulations run the script runAllSim.m



This implementation uses 3rd party code:
